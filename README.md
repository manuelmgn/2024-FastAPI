# 2024 - FastAPI Documentation

Learning notes for FastAPI via its documentation.

October 2024.

## Purpose

What is this repository for? It's my way of summarizing and helping myself study the FastAPI documentation, allowing me to have a guide that's more tailored to my needs in the future.

If you stumbled upon this by chance, it's better to head over to the great [FastAPI documentation](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/learn/).
